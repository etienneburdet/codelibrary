What you can do with a chart, you can do the same with ods-analysis. You get the figures, and do whatever you want in your dashboard with the results !\nThe syntax is different, but options and parameters are pretty similar.

The only prerequisit is, like for a regular join, having a shared key between datasets to make the numerical aggregation match its geo shape.\nBig advantages are mainly to not overweight the statistical dataset by a processing join and storing multiple times the same geo shape in the data. and secondly to choose the geographical granularity or administrative level only when you render the map. A same statistical dataset can now be rendered with several geographical referentials as long as it contains all the needed keys, codes or names to match the geographical shapes.\nFor example: inhabitant dataset of a country can be rendered by region, departement, cities and so on as long as you have the geographical dataset of each administrative layers.\nHow it works: the technique is to aggregate the data with the ods-color-gradient to obtain the color gradient as a color object. Then feed an ods-map with this color object.\n","description":"This widget computes a gradient of colors based on a numerical aggregation.
