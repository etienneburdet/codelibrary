    "summary": "Ods-analysis, a quick intro The technical documentation says :\nThis widget exposes the results of an analysis (as an object containing a results array and optionally an aggregations object) in a variable available in the scope. It can be used with AngularJS\u0026rsquo;s ngRepeat to simply build a table of analysis results.\nNormal people would say :\nOds-analysis is the way to get the values behind a chart ! What you can do with a chart, you can do the same with ods-analysis.",

    "summary": "Static maps, a quick introduction When your goal is to share a precise analysis of a theme, such as employment or demography, for given administrative territories, you may want to disable all interactions with the map. You will even probably want to have overseas territories right next to the other territories in order to visualize immediately how the measurement varies across these administrative areas.\nIn this situation, you might prefer a static colored picture over a classic map widget.",
