[{"categories":["Techtricks"],"contents":"Static maps, a quick introduction When your goal is to share a precise analysis of a theme, such as employment or demography, for given administrative territories, you may want to disable all interactions with the map. You will even probably want to have overseas territories right next to the other territories in order to visualize immediately how the measurement varies across these administrative areas.\nIn this situation, you might prefer a static colored picture over a classic map widget. The ressource below shows you how to create such static analyses of administrative divisions.\n","permalink":"https://opendatasoft.github.io/codelibrary/techtricks/svgmaps/","tags":["ods-maps","widget","map","compute","render"],"title":"SVG Maps"},{"categories":["Empty"],"contents":"Empty Empty\nempty\n","permalink":"https://opendatasoft.github.io/codelibrary/techtricks/empty/","tags":["empty"],"title":"Empty"},{"categories":["Techtricks"],"contents":"Ods-analysis, a quick intro The technical documentation says :\nThis widget exposes the results of an analysis (as an object containing a results array and optionally an aggregations object) in a variable available in the scope. It can be used with AngularJS\u0026rsquo;s ngRepeat to simply build a table of analysis results.\nNormal people would say :\nOds-analysis is the way to get the values behind a chart ! What you can do with a chart, you can do the same with ods-analysis. You get the figures, and do whatever you want in your dashboard with the results !\nThe syntax is different, but options and parameters are pretty similar. You have a context, an X axis, you define series, optionnaly you sort the results. To conclude, we can say that : ods-analysis is the low level widget of ods-chart, its underlying layer !\n","permalink":"https://opendatasoft.github.io/codelibrary/techtricks/odsanalysis/","tags":["ods-analysis","widget","aggregation","analyse","compute","aggregate"],"title":"ODS Analysis"}]
