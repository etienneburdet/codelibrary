## Last but not least, the good practice for geo filters ! (showcasing ods-results)

Each time it's available, filter with the ID! and avoid labels or names!
Specially for geographical division (City names, States etc...)

This resource showcase `ods-results` as the source of ods-select but most of all [Opendatasoft geo referentials](https://data.opendatasoft.com/explore/?refine.publisher=Opendatasoft&refine.theme=Geographical+referentials) that always propose codes and labels for each division.

`ods-results` [documentation](https://help.opendatasoft.com/widgets/#/api/ods-widgets.directive:odsResults).
