## Dynamic map by zoom level

In this example, the French administrative regions, departments and cities are displayed in a specific zoom range.
Regions from the minimum to 6, Departments from 7 to 8, Cities from 9 to the maximum

_You can also configure layers to only be visible between certain zoom levels, using **show-zoom-min**, **show-zoom-max**, or both._
