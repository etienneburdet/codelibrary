## Filter on two different date fields (start and end date)

This example uses the ods-timerange widget to set from and to date, and then filters an events dataset on two different fields.

This is particuarily useful for events datasets with a beginning date of the event and an end date. The timerange selection helps the user to provide his availability, and the result displays events available on this selected period.
