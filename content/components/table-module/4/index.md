title: "Advanced table"
---

This table includes all the functionality presented in the previous examples. This table has a details panel, a dropdown button for actions and a sticky header.
You need to add the `table-advanced` class to your table. If you want to make the header of the table sticky, you will need to add a container `div class="table-module"`.
