## Table with dropdown

This table has a button that opens a dropdown menu, where actions or links can be added.
You need to add the `table-basic` class to your table. If you want to make the header of the table sticky, you will need to add a container `div class="table-module"`.
Check the example below to get the required CSS and HTML in order to get the dropdown button working.
