## Use a map as a selector and display results on the side

This template propose a 2 steps dynamic view. First you propose a map with clickable points or shapes.
- Global information are displayed on the side.
- Then, the user clic on the map, it then open a drawer with specific information relative to the selection.
- Finally, if the user wants to know more about this selection, a second drawer expend to take almost all the screen width.

**This template is the best solution when you desire to display a lot of information and that just can't fit in the default tooltip !**
**N.B.:** grey areas help the user to come back to the map quickly if they want to change their selection
