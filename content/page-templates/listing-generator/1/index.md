## Automated listing visualization

Edit only a few settings to generate a modern looking visulization that uses ODS components and widgets.
[See a live editing demo of this template on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huK1bNGjpkE) 

Try it! Click on "Edit on CodePen" to browse the code and see the config. You only need to edit from line 9 to 27 to try it on your own data! 
For instance :
- On line 12, add `remarques` field to the list to add another filter component.
`filters = ['technique','collection','genre','remarques'];`
- On line 17, change cards to table to change the listing mode !
`view = 'table';`
- Discover all others settings in the documentation in the HTML code

When editing we encourage you to render at 0.5x to see how it looks on wider screens
